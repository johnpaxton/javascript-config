# JavaScript Config

I wanted a repo that collects my various JavaScript config files. This repo should **not** be extended/forked/whatever as a baseline. Since I work in several different environments, and with several different tools (especially in the code formatting and testing areas), I need a clearinghouse to grab the appropriate configs for whatever project I'm working on.

At the moment, it's only one set of files. That could change later.
